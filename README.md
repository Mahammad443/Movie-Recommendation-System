# Movie-Recommendation-System
As part of my Machine Learning course at UMass; I have implemented a recommender system that suggests movies to any user based on user ratings. Recommender System using Item-based Collaborative Filtering Method using Python. Used “Pandas” python library to load MovieLens dataset to recommend movies to users who liked similar movies using item-item similarity score.
