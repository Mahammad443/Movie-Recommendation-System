# Movie-Recommendation-System
As part of my Data Mining course project in Spring 17 at UMass; I have implemented a recommender system that suggests movies to any user based on user ratings. 

Recommender System using Item-based Collaborative Filtering Method using Python. Used “Pandas” python library to load MovieLens dataset to recommend movies to users who liked similar movies using item-item similarity score.

Machine learning python libraries are required to run this program.

Repository contains 2 implementations. First file is a .py file and another is an IPython Notebook. The IPython notebook implementation gives step-by-step output of the application.
